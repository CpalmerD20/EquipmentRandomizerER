# ERBingoRandomizer
A Randomizer mod made for Elden Ring 
This randomizer randomizes weapons by category, including the ranged weapons, which are all counted as one category (bows, light bows, greatbows, crossbows and ballistas are all in the same pool).
It randomizes the starting classes by gives them all random stats. Each class will be level 9 and have a pool of 88 stats. 

# How To Use
The program should find your steam library and find the eldenring.exe path. If not, you can shift + right click your elden ring executable and select "Copy as path". Paste that into the path text box and remove the quotation marks on either side.

Put the seed in that you want to use for randomization, and then hit the Randomize button. When it is done randomizing, the `Bingo!` button will be activated, and clicking it will launch the game with the randomized regulation bin.
